Random Relaxing Server
======================

This repository contains the Go source code for the Google App Engine-powered backend that serves the [Random Relaxing Pics](https://github.com/Raibaz/random-relaxing-pics)  Android app.

The quality of this code is possibly even worse than the one of the Android App, so please don't consider it as a reference: instead, please submit pull requests to improve it :)
